# Google Cloud Platform / Palo Alto Cortex XSOAR

There are two projects I would like to present here. One is Enhancing Cloud Security with Cortex XSOAR on GCP, and the other is Automating Phishing Response with XSOAR on GCP.

These were labs that were completed on Coursera through their Googel Cloud Security program. Attached are their two docs I wrote when completing each lab.
